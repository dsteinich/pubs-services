<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The rate of groundwater flow past underground nuclear testing areas in Yucca Flat at the Nevada National Security Site, southern Nevada, was estimated using results from the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> multiple-well aquifer test (MWAT), done during February 5&#x2013;July 23, 2004. Drawdowns in 13 observation wells were evaluated from pumping in well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> and used as observations in a regional groundwater-flow model to estimate the groundwater-flow rate. Flow from southern Yucca Flat regionally was constrained by detecting drawdown in <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic>, which is 33 miles south-southwest of pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>. Predevelopment flow, the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT, and regional groundwater pumping were simulated in separate models that jointly informed estimates of transmissivity and specific-yield distributions. Predevelopment flow constrained groundwater-flow estimates from southern Yucca Flat because the steady-state model correctly simulated regional groundwater discharges in the Ash Meadows groundwater basin and the surrounding basins. Less than 600 acre-feet per year of groundwater moves from underground nuclear testing areas and flows south of well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> in southern Yucca Flat.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Yucca Flat is in the northeastern part of the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) in Nye County, southern Nevada. From 1957 to 1992, 744 nuclear tests were detonated underground in Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">U.S. Department of Energy, 2015</xref>). Underground nuclear testing has introduced test-generated contaminants into the groundwater system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">Laczniak and others, 1996</xref>). Because of public health concerns posed by underground nuclear testing, the U.S. Department of Energy and other Federal and State agencies are interested in the rate and direction of radionuclide contaminants in groundwater potentially migrating beyond Yucca Flat and the NNSS boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Complex, three-dimensional, groundwater-flow models were developed to estimate the rate and direction of radionuclide migration in groundwater from Yucca Flat (Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2013). The primary objective of the numerical modeling effort was to forecast the extent of the 1,000-year contaminant boundary for Yucca Flat. This boundary is defined as the maximum probable extent at which the concentration of any radionuclide in groundwater exceeds the radiological standards of the Safe Drinking Water Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2012</xref>) in a period of 1,000 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">U.S. Department of Energy, 2000</xref>). The modeling effort (Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2013) and a peer review committee (Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2015) reported a large uncertainty in the lateral extent of the contaminant boundary, where this boundary was sensitive to annual groundwater flow from southern Yucca Flat (Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2013). To reduce uncertainty in the lateral extent of the contaminant boundary, a more accurate estimate of annual groundwater flow through southern Yucca Flat is needed.</p>
<p>Previous estimates of groundwater-flow rates through southern Yucca Flat have ranged from less than 1,000 to greater than 33,000 acre-ft/yr. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson (1975)</xref> estimated a flow rate of less than 1,000 acre-ft/yr based on water levels, hydraulic gradients, and transmissivity estimates from aquifer tests. Groundwater-flow models of the Death Valley regional flow system estimated flow rates of 15,000 acre-ft/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">Belcher and Sweetkind, 2010</xref>) and 2,700 acre-ft/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">Belcher and others, 2017</xref>). A groundwater-flow and transport model of Yucca Flat estimated flow rates ranging from 5,500 to 11,000 acre-ft/yr (Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2013). The greatest estimated flow from southern Yucca Flat exceeded 33,000 acre-ft from an uncertainty analysis of flow into northern Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">Ye and others, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Groundwater flow from Yucca Flat can be better constrained by estimating integrated hydraulic properties with a large-scale aquifer test. Well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> was pumped and water levels were observed in observation wells as part of a multiple-well aquifer test (MWAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture, 2005</xref>). About 75 Mgal (230 acre-ft) of groundwater were withdrawn during <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> well development and aquifer testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture, 2005</xref>). Results from the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT can be used to estimate groundwater flow through southern Yucca Flat because integrated hydraulic properties of a large volume of the aquifer can be estimated where drawdowns are detected miles from the pumping well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">Garcia and others, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">Garcia and others, 2017</xref>). Integrated hydraulic properties, such as a transmissivity-width product, constrain groundwater-flow estimates because groundwater flow is the product of transmissivity-width and horizontal hydraulic gradient. Transmissivity-width product estimates also are relatively independent of conceptual models.</p>
<sec>
<title>Purpose and Scope</title>
<p>The purpose of this report is to estimate annual groundwater flow from southern Yucca Flat using results from the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT in which drawdowns were estimated in 13 observation wells. Drawdowns were differentiated from environmental fluctuations using water-level models, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Halford and others (2012)</xref>, in eight observation wells that were monitored continuously. Drawdowns also were estimated from discrete, depth-to-water measurements in five observation wells. A regional groundwater-flow model was calibrated previously to drawdowns from the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT in addition to predevelopment water-level altitudes and discharges (Halford and Jackson, 2019). Groundwater flow from southern Yucca Flat was estimated with the regional steady-state model and transmissivity-width product analyses. Supporting data and accompanying analyses are published in an independent data release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Jackson and others, 2019</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Description of Study Area</title>
<p>The study area encompasses four groundwater basins: (1) Pahute Mesa&#x2013;Oasis Valley; (2) Alkali Flat&#x2013;Furnace Creek Ranch; (3) Pahrump to Death Valley South; and (4) Ash Meadows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>), where the focus of investigation is the Ash Meadows groundwater basin. Inclusion of the surrounding basins allows the regional groundwater-flow model to correctly simulate boundary conditions for the Ash Meadows groundwater basin and constrain groundwater flow from southern Yucca Flat.</p>
<p>The focused area of investigation spans from Yucca Flat sub-basin to the Ash Meadows discharge area. Yucca Flat is a 170-mi<sup>2</sup> sub-basin within the 4,200-mi<sup>2</sup> Ash Meadows groundwater basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Fenelon and others, 2016</xref>). The Ash Meadows discharge area is the primary discharge area in the Ash Meadows groundwater basin, where groundwater discharge from springs, seeps, and phreatophytes totals 18,000 acre-ft/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">Laczniak and others, 1999</xref>). Interbasin flow occurs north of the Ash Meadows discharge area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>), where an additional 2,500 acre-ft/yr of groundwater moves from the Ash Meadows groundwater basin to the Alkali Flat&#x2013;Furnace Creek Ranch groundwater basin (Halford and Jackson, 2019).</p>
<p>The Ash Meadows groundwater basin is part of the Death Valley regional groundwater-flow system within the Great Basin physiographic province (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">Harrill and Prudic, 1998</xref>). Dominant topographic features bounding the Ash Meadows groundwater basin include (1) Belted, Groom, and Timpahute Ranges to the north; (2) Sheep and Pahranagat Ranges to the east; (3) Spring Mountains to the south; and (4) Rainier Mesa, Eleana Range, Skull Mountain, and Specter Range to the west. Yucca Flat sub-basin is bounded by (1) Quartzite Ridge to the north; (2) Halfpint Range to the east and southeast; (3) CP Hills to the south; and (3) Eleana Range, Syncline Ridge, and Mine Mountain to the west. Altitudes in the Ash Meadows groundwater basin range from about 2,200 ft in the Ash Meadows discharge area to 11,916 ft at Mount Charleston in the Spring Mountains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>). The floor of Yucca Flat sub-basin ranges in altitude from about 3,900 to 4,500 ft from southern to northern Yucca Flat, respectively.</p>

<p>Previous investigators have classified geologic units into hydrogeologic units based on rock hydraulic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">Laczniak and others, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">Slate and others, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">Bechtel Nevada, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">Fenelon and others, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">2016</xref>). Hydrogeologic units categorize geologic units as aquifers or confining units based on their ability to store and transmit groundwater.</p>
<p>The lower clastic confining unit (LCCU), upper clastic confining unit (UCCU), and Mesozoic granite confining unit (MGCU) are grouped in a single hydrogeologic unit because these units are hydraulically similar. LCCU, UCCU, and MGCU compose the mountain ranges bounding eastern, western, and northern Yucca Flat sub-basin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">Sweetkind and others, 2010</xref>). LCCU consists of Neoproterozoic to Lower Cambrian quartzite, siltstone, gneiss, and schist. LCCU forms the hydrologic basement of the Ash Meadows groundwater basin and composes the eastern part of the Halfpint Range. UCCU consists of Late Devonian to Mississippian quartzites, shales, and argillites, which compose the Eleana Range, Syncline Ridge, and Mine Mountain. MGCU consists of small granitic intrusions, which occur locally near Rainier Mesa and Quartzite Ridge. LCCU, UCCU, and MGCU are characterized by negligible primary porosity and permeability but may be complexly fractured. However, discontinuous fracture networks cause these rocks to be nearly impermeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig02" position="float" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Hydrogeologic units at the water table, directions of groundwater flow, and location of pumping and observation wells, Yucca Flat sub-basin and vicinity, southern Nevada.</p><p content-type="toc"><bold>Figure 2.</bold> Map showing hydrogeologic units at the water table, directions of groundwater flow, and location of pumping and observation wells, Yucca Flat sub-basin and vicinity, southern Nevada.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sac19-4232_fig02"/></fig>
<p>The carbonate aquifer consists of the lower carbonate aquifer (LCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>). The LCA is a regional carbonate-rock aquifer that is part of the Great Basin carbonate-rock province (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">Prudic and others, 1995</xref>). The LCA occurs throughout the Ash Meadows groundwater basin (and much of Yucca Flat; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>), consists of a thick sequence of Paleozoic limestones and dolostones, and has saturated thicknesses of more than 15,000 ft in some areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">Laczniak and others, 1996</xref>). However, only the upper few thousand feet of saturated LCA are considered hydraulically active, with little flow occurring in the deeper parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>). These rocks have negligible matrix porosity and permeability. Aquifer-test results indicate that the LCA has a wide range in transmissivity (from less than 100 ft<sup>2</sup>/d to more than 1,000,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/d) because of variable faulting and fracturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Thin, localized volcanic aquifers occur in Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>). Volcanic aquifers consist of moderately to densely welded ash-flow tuffs, where fracturing causes a laterally extensive and hydraulically connected fracture network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">Laczniak and others, 1996</xref>). Volcanic aquifers have saturated thicknesses of less than 2,000 ft in Yucca Flat sub-basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Basin-fill deposits form thin, localized aquifers and confining units in the intermontane basins within the Ash Meadows groundwater basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">Sweetkind and others, 2010</xref>). Coarse-grained basin fill typically consists of alluvial and colluvial deposits with minor fluvial, debris-flow, and eolian deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">Slate and others, 1999</xref>). Coarse-grained deposits are characterized by high matrix porosity and permeability, and typically form aquifers. Fine-grained basin fill forms confining units, which consist of playa and lacustrine sediments. Basin-fill deposits increase in thickness from the margins to the center of intermontane basins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">Bechtel Nevada, 2006</xref>), and are unsaturated throughout most of Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>). However, basin-fill aquifers have saturated thicknesses of less than 1,500 ft in localized areas along the central corridor of Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A thick volcanic tuff confining unit (TCU) forms a hydraulic barrier between overlying basin-fill and volcanic aquifers and the underlying LCA throughout most of Yucca Flat sub-basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>). Rocks composing the TCU are commonly zeolitized and consist of nonwelded or partially welded ash-flow tuffs, bedded tuffs, and reworked tuffaceous sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">Sawyer and others, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">Laczniak and others, 1996</xref>). These rocks typically form confining units because mineral alteration to zeolites reduces matrix permeability and the low susceptibility of these rocks to strain fracture reduces fracture permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>). The saturated thickness of the TCU typically ranges from 500 to 2,000 ft and is more than 2,500 ft in central Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Predevelopment Flow</title>
<p>Groundwater recharge occurs where precipitation infiltrates permeable rocks and percolates below the root zone to the water table, either through an interconnected network of fractures or the rock matrix. Greater amounts of precipitation occur at higher altitudes; consequently, greater amounts of recharge typically occur in highland areas. An exception to this conceptualization occurs where low-permeability rocks underlie highland areas. In these areas, precipitation from snowmelt (or high-intensity rainfall) flows downgradient and infiltrates adjacent alluvial-fan deposits. Some surface runoff, and subsequent recharge, occurs in ephemeral channels draining highland areas.</p>
<p>More groundwater recharge is derived from ranges bounding the Ash Meadows groundwater basin than from ranges bounding Yucca Flat sub-basin. Potential groundwater recharge for most of the Ash Meadows groundwater basin occurs in highland areas such as the Spring Mountains, and the Belted, Groom, Timpahute, Pahranagat, Sheep, Desert, Pintwater, and Spotted Ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Fenelon and others, 2016</xref>). Potential groundwater recharge to Yucca Flat sub-basin occurs locally from precipitation infiltrating bounding ranges, including the Eleana, Belted, and Halfpint Ranges; CP Hills; Mine Mountain; and Syncline Ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>). Substantially less precipitation and recharge occur in Yucca Flat sub-basin than in the Ash Meadows groundwater basin because highland areas bounding the sub-basin have altitudes of 4,000&#x2013;7,000 ft, whereas highland areas bounding the Ash Meadows groundwater basin have altitudes of 6,000&#x2013;12,000 ft.</p>
<p>Groundwater generally moves in a south-southwest direction in the Ash Meadows groundwater basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Fenelon and others, 2016</xref>). Groundwater moves from highland recharge areas to areas where groundwater discharges predominantly at springs and seeps. The two areas of groundwater discharge in the Ash Meadows groundwater basin are at Indian Springs and Ash Meadows discharge area. An additional amount of groundwater moves as interbasin flow from the Ash Meadows groundwater basin to the Alkali Flat&#x2013;Furnace Creek Ranch groundwater basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Water levels, hydraulic gradients, and geologic evidence indicate that all groundwater leaves Yucca Flat through the LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>). Thin, localized basin-fill and volcanic rocks form a laterally continuous aquifer in the central part of Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>). Lateral movement of groundwater from basin-fill and volcanic aquifers to areas downgradient of Yucca Flat is prohibited by the TCU, which acts as a flow barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>). Instead, hydraulic gradients indicate lateral groundwater flow toward a hydraulic sink in central Yucca Flat. Water levels in these aquifers are elevated 20&#x2013;100 ft above water levels in the LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>). The presence of a hydraulic sink and elevated water levels indicates that groundwater moves downward as vertical leakage across the TCU into the underlying LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>). Potentiometric contours show that, once groundwater moves into the LCA, groundwater moves southward out of Yucca Flat sub-basin to downgradient discharge areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Predevelopment groundwater-flow rates in the LCA through Yucca Flat sub-basin range from 350 to 1,000 acre-ft/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">Harrill and others, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Fenelon and others, 2016</xref>). These groundwater-flow rates were estimated using Darcy&#x2019;s law or basin flow balance approaches. Estimated groundwater-flow rates account for locally derived recharge into highland areas bounding the sub-basin, and groundwater flow that enters the sub-basin from the north and southeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Locally derived recharge in Yucca Flat sub-basin moves vertically and laterally from the surrounding rocks into the LCA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson (1975)</xref> estimated vertical leakage rates through the TCU ranging from 25 to 65 acre-ft/yr. These estimates were computed with Darcy&#x2019;s law using a vertical hydraulic gradient of 0.2 ft/ft; vertical hydraulic conductivities of 8 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-6</sup> and 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-5</sup> ft/d, based on 38 core samples of the TCU; and a surficial area of the TCU in contact with LCA of 66 mi<sup>2</sup>. Most lateral leakage into the LCA likely occurs from precipitation-derived recharge from highlands in the west and northeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Fenelon and others, 2012</xref>), where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson (1975)</xref> estimated a lateral leakage rate of 250 acre-ft/yr. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">Harrill and others (1988)</xref> estimated a total lateral and vertical leakage rate into the LCA of 700 acre-ft/yr.</p>
<p>Most groundwater flow enters Yucca Flat sub-basin from the Halfpint Range in the southeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson (1975)</xref> estimated a groundwater-flow rate of less than 100 acre-ft/yr into the LCA from the southeast, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">Harrill and others (1988)</xref> estimated a groundwater-flow rate of about 300 acre-ft/yr into the LCA.</p>
<p>Groundwater flow may enter northern Yucca Flat sub-basin from Emigrant Valley; however, if this occurs, the flow is limited because low-permeability rocks act as a flow barrier. At the water table, Yucca Flat sub-basin is bounded by the LCCU to the northeast in the Halfpint Range, the MGCU to the north, and the UCCU to the west in the Eleana Range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>). These rocks form a hydraulic barrier, as evidenced by low transmissivities (0.1 ft<sup>2</sup>/d) and steep hydraulic gradients (1,300 ft/mi) between Emigrant Valley and Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson, 1975</xref>). Using Darcy&#x2019;s law, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Winograd and Thordarson (1975)</xref> estimated a groundwater-flow rate of less than 40 acre-ft/yr into the LCA from Emigrant Valley.</p>
<p>Failure to use groundwater-flow rates as constraints during calibration of numerical models has resulted in estimates that greatly exceed 40 acre-ft/yr through northern Yucca Flat from Emigrant Valley. A groundwater-flow model of the Death Valley regional flow system estimated a flow rate through northern Yucca Flat of 14,000 acre-ft/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">Belcher and Sweetkind, 2010</xref>). This model subsequently provided boundary conditions for a Yucca Flat LCA model&#x2014;a groundwater-flow and transport model of the LCA focused on Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture, 2006</xref>). Using the erroneously large flow rate from the north resulted in rapid groundwater velocities and model-estimated hydraulic properties in Yucca Flat that exceeded results from aquifer tests. An uncertainty analysis was done to bound the northern flow estimates, but that analysis also did not use a flow constraint; northern flow rates ranged from 15,000 to 33,000 acre-ft/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">Ye and others, 2010</xref>). This range is obviously wrong because the much larger Ash Meadows groundwater basin receives about 22,000 acre-ft of annual recharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Fenelon and others, 2016</xref>). In a revised Yucca Flat LCA model, northern flow rates ranged from 2,000 to 7,500 acre-ft/yr (Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2013). However, these revised northern flow rates are still too high. Inflow through northern Yucca Flat is expected to be only a minor component of the total flow in the Ash Meadows groundwater basin.</p>
<p>Unreasonably high estimates of annual groundwater flow through northern Yucca Flat have been addressed in more recent numerical models. An updated groundwater-flow model of the Death Valley regional flow system estimated a northern flow rate of 530 acre-ft/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">Belcher and others, 2017</xref>). The Death Valley (version 3) regional groundwater-flow model (DV3) estimated a northern flow rate of 220 acre-ft/yr (Halford and Jackson, 2019).</p>

<title><italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> Multiple-Well Aquifer Test</title>
<p>A multiple-well aquifer test (MWAT) was done in southern Yucca Flat in 2004 to investigate postulated preferential flow paths along faults in the LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">Bechtel Nevada, 2004</xref>). The MWAT was done as part of a tracer test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture, 2005</xref>); however, this report focuses on analysis of the MWAT to estimate integrated hydraulic properties of and flow rates through Yucca Flat. During the MWAT, well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> was pumped, water levels were measured continuously (at 15-sec or 15-min intervals) in eight observation wells, and water levels were measured periodically (from 5 to 117 days) in five additional wells. The pumping well and eight observation wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>) were instrumented with pressure transducers by a private contractor, Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Depth-to-water in five wells was measured periodically by the USGS with calibrated electric tapes. Drawdowns from pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> were estimated in the 13 monitored wells.</p>

<p>The horizontal distance from pumping to observation wells ranged from 0 to 33 mi. Pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> and 12 observation wells are open to the LCA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>). Observation well <italic>ER-6-1-2 piezometer</italic> is open to the TCU. For the MWAT, a well packer divided the main completion of well <italic>ER-6-1</italic> into a lower and upper zone, and the zones were monitored separately.</p>
<p>Well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> was pumped during February 5&#x2013;July 23, 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture, 2005</xref>). Pumping included well development and step-drawdown testing, a 9-day constant-rate test, and a 90-day constant-rate test (fig. 3). Well development and step-drawdown testing occurred from February 5 to 11, 2004. The 9-day constant-rate test was done during February 12&#x2013;21, 2004, where well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> was pumped at a constant rate of about 522 gal/min. About 11 Mgal of groundwater were withdrawn from February 5 to 21, 2004, during well development, step-drawdown testing, and the 9-day constant-rate test. The 90-day constant-rate test was done during April 24&#x2013;July 23, 2004, where well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> was pumped at a constant rate of about 524 gal/min, and about 64 Mgal of groundwater were withdrawn. The 90-day constant-rate test had a scheduled pumping interruption from July 8, 2004 at 1655 hours to July 12, 2004 at 0735 hours to create a calibration point for tracer transport analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture, 2005</xref>). Well development, step-drawdown testing, and the constant-rate testing were considered a single MWAT because water levels likely did not recover between pumping periods, as suggested by water-level data in well <italic>ER-7-1</italic>. Withdrawals totaled about 75 Mgal.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected before, during, and after aquifer testing. Continuous water-level, water-temperature, and barometric-pressure data at the pumping well and at seven of eight observation wells (excluding <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>) were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture (2005)</xref>. The pumping history for well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> during well development and aquifer testing also was obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture (2005)</xref>. Continuous water-level, water-temperature, and barometric-pressure data at <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> and depth-to-water measurements in five observation wells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>) were retrieved from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis">https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis</ext-link>). The pumping history for well <italic>Army 1 WW</italic>, which was used in drawdown analyses at wells <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> and <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic>, was obtained from the USGS&#x2013;U.S. Department of Energy Cooperative Studies in Nevada web (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nevada.usgs.gov/doe_nv">https://nevada.usgs.gov/doe_nv</ext-link>). Compiled continuous data, depth-to-water measurements, and groundwater-withdrawal data are provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Jackson and others (2019)</xref>.</p>
<p>Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture measured continuous data at the pumping well and at seven of eight observation wells (excluding <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic>), and the pumping rates for well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>. Water levels and temperature were measured using pressure transducers that either directly measure the pressure of the overlying water column (vented) or measure total pressure of the atmosphere and overlying water column (nonvented). The vented WaterLOG<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Series H-310-30 pressure transducer (Design Analysis Associates, Incorporated, Logan, Utah) has a depth range of 0&#x2013;69.20 ft [0&#x2013;30 lb/in<sup>2</sup> gauge] with an accuracy of <underline>+</underline>0.014 ft, and a temperature range of 0&#x2013;40 &#x00B0;C with an accuracy of <underline>+</underline>1 &#x00B0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">Fletcher, 2018</xref>). The nonvented Model PS9800<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> pressure transducer (Seametrics, Kent, Washington) has a depth range of 0&#x2013;81 ft [0&#x2013;50 lb/in<sup>2</sup> absolute] with an accuracy of <underline>+</underline>0.081 ft, and a temperature range of 0&#x2013;50 &#x00B0;C with an accuracy of <underline>+</underline>0.3 &#x00B0;C (Seametrics, 2018). Barometric pressure was measured using Model PTB-101<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> barometers, which have an accuracy of <underline>+</underline>0.004 lb/in<sup>2</sup> gauge at 20 &#x00B0;C (68 &#x00B0;F) (Vaisala, 2005). Campbell Scientific CR10 and CR10X data loggers with integrated barometers were used to record water-level, temperature, and barometric-pressure data at the pumping and seven observation wells every 15 sec or if a water-level change greater than 0.5 lb/in<sup>2</sup> occurred. Pumping rates in well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> were measured with a 4-in. Foxboro 8004A magnetic flowmeter and integrated transmitter (series IMT 25), which transmitted production rates to a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger. The flowmeter system measures production rates of as much as 2,000 gal/min and has a flow rate accuracy of 0.25 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">Foxboro Company, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Manual depth-to-water measurements in five observation wells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>) and continuous water-level, water-temperature, and barometric-pressure data at <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> were measured by the USGS. Depth-to-water measurements were collected using calibrated electric tapes manufactured by Solinst Canada Limited (Georgetown, Ontario; Model 101) and RST Instruments Limited (Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada). The material used in Solinst electric tapes is medium-density polyethylene, whereas the material used in RST Instruments electric tapes is polyethylene-coated steel. The calibrated electric tapes are marked with 0.01-ft graduations but have an accuracy of +0.1 ft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">Fulford and Clayton, 2015</xref>). During the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT, water levels and temperature in <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> were measured continuously at 15-min intervals using a vented WaterLOG<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Series H-310-15 submersible pressure transducer. The pressure transducer has a depth range of 0&#x2013;34.60 ft (0&#x2013;15 lb/in<sup>2</sup> gauge) with an accuracy of <underline>+</underline>0.007 ft, and a temperature range of 0&#x2013;40 &#x00B0;C with an accuracy of <underline>+</underline> 1&#x00B0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">Fletcher, 2018</xref>). Barometric pressure was measured using a Met One 090 barometer, which has a range of 8.7&#x2013;14.5 lb/in<sup>2</sup> gauge and an accuracy of <underline>+</underline>0.005 lb/in<sup>2</sup> gauge at 20 &#x00B0;C (68 &#x00B0;F). A Sutron Model 8200 data logger with an integrated barometer was used to record water-level, temperature, and barometric-pressure data at <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> every 15 min.</p>

<title>Drawdown Estimation</title>
<p>Drawdowns at eight observation wells from pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> were estimated from continuous water-level data using a water-level modeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Halford and others, 2012</xref>), which uses an analytical model to fit a synthetic curve to measured water levels. The synthetic curve is the sum of one or more time-series components that explain water-level fluctuations in the measured data. Water-level models (WLMs) were used to estimate drawdowns masked by environmental noise by removing water-level fluctuations due to barometric pressure and tidal forces from the measured data. WLMs were generated using SeriesSEE, a Microsoft Excel<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> add-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Halford and others, 2012</xref>). All WLM analyses discussed in this report are published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Jackson and others (2019)</xref>.</p>
<p>Drawdowns at five observation wells from pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> were estimated from manual, depth-to-water measurements. Water-level fluctuations due to barometric pressure and tidal forces were not removed from manual measurements. Visual inspection of more recent (2017) continuous water-level data in these observation wells and other wells in Yucca Flat indicate that barometric pressure and tidal forces cause water levels to fluctuate <underline>+</underline>0.2 ft. To account for water-level fluctuations due to measurement error, barometric pressure, and tidal forces, error bars of <underline>+</underline>0.2 ft were added to provide an approximate range of uncertainty in estimated drawdowns. All drawdown analyses from depth-to-water measurements are published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Jackson and others (2019)</xref>.</p>
<sec>
<title>Continuous Data and Water-Level Models</title>
<p>Drawdowns were estimated with water-level modeling because environmental (non-pumping) water-level fluctuations masked drawdown from pumping in observation wells. Drawdowns in observation wells from pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> were analytically modeled with a Theis transform of the pumping signal, where water-level changes from multiple pumping rates were simulated by superimposing multiple <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">Theis (1935)</xref> solutions. Theis transforms serve as simple transform functions, where step-wise pumping records are translated into approximate water-level responses. Numerical experiments have confirmed that superimposed Theis transforms closely approximate water-level responses, even in hydrogeologically complex aquifer systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">Garcia and others, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Synthetic water levels in WLMs represent summed time series of water-level fluctuations resulting from earth tides, gravity tides, barometric pressure, and pumping responses. Earth and gravity tides were computed functions based on well-established theoretical equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">Harrison, 1971</xref>). Hourly-to-weekly fluctuations in barometric pressure were simulated with moving averages of barometric-pressure data measured at or near each observation well. Pumping responses (drawdowns) at an observation well were simulated with Theis transforms of the pumping schedule from well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>.</p>
<p>Synthetic water levels were fit to measured water levels by minimizing the root-mean-square error of differences between synthetic and measured water levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Halford and others, 2012</xref>). Amplitude and phase were adjusted in each time series used to simulate environmental water-level fluctuations (barometric pressure and tides). Transmissivity and the storage coefficient were adjusted in the Theis transform model.</p>
<p>The drawdown estimate at an observation well is the summation of Theis transforms minus residual differences between synthetic and measured water levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Halford and others, 2012</xref>). The summation of all Theis transforms is the direct estimate of the pumping signal. Residuals (measured minus synthetic water levels) represent all unexplained water-level fluctuations. These fluctuations primarily are random (noise) during non-pumping periods but can contain unexplained components of the pumping signal during pumping periods.</p>
<p>Drawdown detection was classified as detected or not detected based on the signal-to-noise ratio. Signal and noise are defined herein as the maximum simulated drawdown occurring in an observation well during an aquifer test and the root-mean-square error, respectively. Drawdown was classified as detected where the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than or equal to 5. Drawdown was classified as not detected where the signal-to-noise ratio was less than 5, indicating drawdown (if any) could not be reliably differentiated from the noise.</p>

<title>Depth-to-Water Measurements</title>
<p>Drawdowns at five observation wells from pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> were estimated from manual, depth-to-water measurements. Water-level declines were estimated from pumping during <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> aquifer testing by subtracting depth-to-water measurements during the period of pumping from the first depth-to-water measurement prior to pumping. Error bars of <underline>+</underline>0.2 ft were added to drawdowns to account for water-level fluctuations due to barometric pressure, tidal forces, and measurement error. Drawdowns estimated from depth-to-water measurements are less accurate than drawdowns estimated from continuous water-level data and are used to provide a qualitative comparison to numerical results.</p>

<title>Boundary Flow Estimation</title>
<p>Groundwater flow from southern Yucca Flat was estimated using a regional, three-dimensional, groundwater-flow model, referred to as Death Valley (version 3) (DV3; Halford and Jackson, 2019). The DV3 model couples steady-state (predevelopment) and transient (pumping), three-dimensional, finite-difference, numerical models (MODFLOW 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">Harbaugh, 2005</xref>). Drawdowns estimated from continuous data and manual measurements were used as measured observations during the simulation of <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> well development and aquifer testing from February 5 to July 23, 2004. The groundwater-flow rate from Yucca Flat was estimated by simultaneously calibrating to steady-state and transient conditions.</p>
<sec>
<title>Estimation of Hydraulic Properties and Numerical Model Description</title>
<p>Recharge, hydraulic-conductivity, specific-yield, and specific-storage distributions were estimated by simultaneously calibrating multiple, three-dimensional, numerical groundwater models of the study area (Halford and Jackson, 2019). Multiple models were used to differentiate and better interpret effects of predevelopment flow, groundwater development, and aquifer tests on the groundwater system. Multiple models allow boundary conditions to be better constrained to known (predevelopment or pumping) conditions and to allow comparison of simulated responses to those known conditions. For example, discharge from Big Spring in the Ash Meadows discharge area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>) averaged 2.3 ft<sup>3</sup>/s prior to development and the pool altitude was 2,240 ft. Multiple models allowed simulating Big Spring as a specified discharge of 2.3 ft<sup>3</sup>/s prior to development and as a capture-limited, head-dependent boundary during groundwater development. This prevented misfits between simulated and measured pool altitudes from affecting simulated capture during groundwater development.</p>
<p>Predevelopment conditions, the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT, groundwater development in Ash Meadows and Alkali Flat&#x2013;Furnace Creek Ranch groundwater basins, and groundwater development in the Pahrump to Death Valley South groundwater basin were simulated with four separate, but coupled, groundwater-flow models. The Death Valley (version 3) steady-state model (DV3-SS) simulated predevelopment conditions and informed estimates of recharge rates and hydraulic conductivities. The Death Valley (version 3) transient model of <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> multiple-well aquifer test (DV3-ER612) simulated changes from pumping during <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> well development and aquifer testing from February 5 to July 23, 2004, and informed estimates of hydraulic properties between wells <italic>UE-10j (2232-2297 ft)</italic> and <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>). The Death Valley (version 3) transient model of Ash Meadows and Alkali Flat&#x2013;Furnace Creek Ranch basins (DV3-AM-AFFCR) simulated changes from groundwater development from 1950 to 2018 in the Ash Meadows and Alkali Flat&#x2013;Furnace Creek Ranch groundwater basins. The Death Valley (version 3) transient model of Pahrump to Death Valley South groundwater basin (DV3-PDVS) simulated changes from groundwater development from 1913 to 2018 in the Pahrump to Death Valley South groundwater basin. Transient DV3-ER612, DV3-AM-AFFCR, and DV3-PDVS models informed estimates of hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and specific storage where pumping measurably changed water levels or discharges.</p>
<p>All groundwater-flow models shared a common domain, grid, and hydrogeologic framework. Model domains extended laterally to no-flow boundaries at the outer boundaries of the four groundwater basins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>). Each model was divided areally into 268 rows of 221 columns of variably spaced, rectangular cells that ranged from 820 ft (250 m) to 4,921 ft (1,500 m) on a side. Models extended vertically from the water table to 3,280 ft (1,000 m) below sea level and were divided into six layers that successively increased in thickness with depth. Layer 1 was 1-ft thick to better simulate groundwater and surface-water interaction, and drainage at the water table. All models have the same hydrogeologic framework of the Death Valley regional flow system (Halford and Jackson, 2019). This framework has nine hydrogeologic units that were divided primarily based on rock type and depth below the water table. Hydraulic-conductivity, specific-yield, and specific-storage distributions are identical in each calibrated model because all models shared a common hydrogeologic framework.</p>
<p>Hydraulic properties and recharge rates were distributed using pilot points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">RamaRao and others, 1995</xref>). Hydraulic properties smoothly varied within hydrogeologic units but were not extrapolated between hydrogeologic units. Recharge similarly was distributed using pilot points, but preferred rates were guided by a conceptual model that considered water availability (precipitation) and occurrence of low-permeability rocks at the water table that likely impeded infiltration.</p>
<p>Hydraulic properties and recharge rates were assigned to pilot points and adjusted to minimize a weighted sum-of-squares objective function with the parameter estimation program PEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">Doherty, 2016</xref>). The following were compared to simulated equivalents in the objective function:</p>

<list-item><label>&#x2022;</label><p>Water-level changes and spring capture from groundwater development.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Conceptual distributions of recharge and hydraulic properties were incorporated in the objective function through Tikhonov regularization and primarily influenced estimates where data were limited.</p>
<p>Groundwater-flow estimates from southern Yucca Flat were informed primarily by DV3-ER612 and DV3-SS models. The DV3-ER612 model simulated pumping during the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT and was calibrated to drawdowns in 13 observation wells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">table 2</xref>). Transmissivity of the carbonate rocks beneath Yucca Flat was estimated primarily by the DV3-ER612 model. The DV3-SS model simulated predevelopment flow. Water-level altitudes in wells, water-level differences between paired wells, and transmissivity estimates from other aquifer tests constrained calibration in Yucca Flat sub-basin. Recharge and groundwater-flow estimates from the DV3-SS model were constrained regionally. This was because groundwater-discharge areas were simulated by specifying measured rates for 97 percent of total discharge.</p>

<p>[<bold>USGS well name:</bold> U.S. Geological Survey well name. <bold>Drawdown analysis period:</bold> Start and end date of water-level record used to estimate drawdowns. <bold>Estimated maximum drawdown:</bold> For observation wells with continuous water-level data, maximum drawdown was estimated by matching a synthetic curve of non-pumping (environmental) and pumping responses to measured water levels in the observation well. For observation wells with depth-to-water measurements, maximum drawdown was estimated by subtracting depth-to-water measurements during the period of pumping from the first depth-to-water measurement prior to pumping. A less than (&lt;) qualifier is used if drawdown was not detected or is censored. <bold>RMS error:</bold> Root-mean-square (RMS) error between measured and synthetic water levels in water-level model. A &#x201C;&#x2013;&#x201D; indicates results not available because drawdown was not estimated with a water-level model. <bold>Signal-to-noise ratio:</bold> ratio of estimated maximum drawdown (signal) to RMS error (noise). A &#x201C;&#x2013;&#x201D; indicates results not available because drawdown was not estimated with a water-level model. <bold>Drawdown detection:</bold> Drawdown detection is classified as not detected, detected, or censored. Drawdown is not detected where the signal-to-noise ratio is &lt;5, indicating drawdown cannot be reliably differentiated from the noise in the dataset. Drawdown is detected definitively where the signal-to-noise ratio is &#x2265;5 and correlation between environmental fluctuations and pumping signals is unlikely. For observation wells with depth-to-water measurements, drawdown is detected if measurements show visibly discernible water-level declines during <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> pumping, whereas drawdown is censored if measurements do not show visibly discernible water-level declines during <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> pumping because any potential drawdown was masked by barometric pressure and tidal forces. Error bars account for <underline underline-style="UTHICK">&#x00B1;</underline> 0.2 ft water-level fluctuations from barometric pressure, tides, and measurement error]</p>

<title>Goodness of Fit</title>
<p>Simulated and measured steady-state water levels in the DV3-SS model agreed with root-mean-square errors of 49 and 20 ft beneath the study area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">fig. 4A</xref>) and Yucca Flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), respectively. Water-table altitude comparisons to land surface were used to ensure that the simulated water table remained below land surface, and water-level altitudes at spring pools and in groundwater evapotranspiration areas were used to ensure that simulated water levels were at or near land surface. Water-level residuals showed little spatial pattern of significance, suggesting a good overall fit between simulated and measured water levels. Average and root-mean-square water-level errors of +1 and 49 ft, respectively, were not large relative to the 8,800-ft range of measured water levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Simulated and estimated drawdowns in the DV3-ER612 model agreed with a root-mean-square error of 0.02 ft.</p>

<p>Simulated and measured gradients between wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> through southern Yucca Flat closely agree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">fig. 5</xref>). Simulated water-level profiles replicate the shape of the measured water table along north-south and west-east cross sections under steady-state conditions.

<p>Differences between measured and simulated LCA water levels are attributed mostly to temperature effects. The measured free-water surface in the well can differ from the head in the aquifer by more than 10 ft, even though heads are identical in the well and aquifer. For example, measured water-level altitudes were 2,394 and 2,389 ft in wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>U-3cn 5</italic>, respectively, during 2015. From the free-water surface to the open interval in well <italic>ER-7-1</italic>, a length of about 620 ft, the water temperature is about 115 &#x00B0;F, indicating that the head is minimally affected by temperature. However, temperatures along a 1,400-ft water column in well <italic>U-3cn 5</italic> ranged from 91 &#x00B0;F at the free-water surface to 154 &#x00B0;F in the interval open to the LCA. Measured water levels in well <italic>U-3cn 5</italic> would be 12 ft higher if the temperature of the 1,400-ft water column was uniform and at formation temperature (154 &#x00B0;F). These are substantial differences that were addressed by acknowledging uncertainty in uncorrected water levels. Formal corrections were not attempted because intervening distributions of hydraulic conductivity and temperature between wells are unknown. In Yucca Flat, relatively cool water columns are present in the casing of LCA wells that penetrate greater than 1,000 ft of TCU. Free-water surface temperatures range from 66 to 122 &#x00B0;F and are lowest where the TCU is thickest in central Yucca Flat (19&#x2013;50 &#x00B0;C; Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2013).</p>

<title>Flow Computation Approaches</title>
<p>Groundwater-flow rates from southern Yucca Flat were estimated between wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> because all flow through nuclear testing areas passes between these wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">fig. 2</xref>). A southern boundary (between wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>) was delineated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">fig. 6</xref>) using the simulated water-table from the DV3-SS model, steady-state flow paths, a simulated transmissivity map, and estimated drawdowns at observation wells (Halford and Jackson, 2019). The southern boundary is perpendicular to simulated water-table contours and steady-state flow paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">fig. 6</xref>). Note that wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> occur in a high-transmissivity corridor in east-central Yucca Flat that is bounded on the east and west by low-transmissivity rocks. Because transmissivity is correlated to groundwater flow, a high-transmissivity corridor bounded by low-transmissivity rocks indicates that most groundwater flowing south from Yucca Flat passes through this high-transmissivity corridor.</p>
<fig id="fig06" position="float" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Pumping and observation wells, simulated water-level contours and transmissivity, and physiographic features, Yucca Flat sub-basin and vicinity, southern Nevada.</p><p content-type="toc"><bold>Figure 6.</bold> Map showing pumping and observation wells, simulated water-level contours and transmissivity, and physiographic features, Yucca Flat sub-basin and vicinity, southern Nevada.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sac19-4232_fig06"/></fig>
<p>The groundwater-flow rate from southern Yucca Flat was estimated directly using the DV3-SS model and indirectly from transmissivity-width products calculated over an area of high transmissivity between wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">fig. 6</xref>). Simulated flow rates from Yucca Flat were extracted from the DV3-SS model with the direct approach using Zone Budget, a MODFLOW groundwater utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">Harbaugh, 1990</xref>). The transmissivity-width approach estimates flow across southern Yucca Flat using Darcy&#x2019;s Law and a simulated transmissivity map. The use of alternative approaches indicates the range in uncertainty of groundwater-flow rates from Yucca Flat.</p>
<p>In the transmissivity-width approach, the groundwater-flow rate was computed as the product of transmissivity, aquifer width, and horizontal hydraulic gradient between wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>. The horizontal hydraulic gradient was the difference between average measured heads in wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>. More than 40 water-level measurements were averaged from 2005 to 2015 in each well. Heads consistently differed by 2.6 ft between these wells and the hydraulic gradient was 0.42 ft/mi. Aquifer width is the east-west width of the transmissive corridor. Groundwater-flow rates from southern Yucca Flat were computed using the geometric mean (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e01">eq. 1</xref>) and harmonic mean (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e02">eq. 2</xref>) of transmissivity-width products:<disp-formula id="e01">	<alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="m1">

<title>Hydraulic Responses from <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> Multiple-Well Aquifer Test</title>
<p>Drawdowns in observation wells were estimated from continuous water-level data and manual depth-to-water measurements. Continuous water-level data in eight observation wells were analyzed for drawdowns using WLMs. WLM analyses showing fitting parameters, measured and synthetic water levels, and drawdown estimates for the eight analyzed wells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">table 1</xref>) are provided in a corresponding data release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Jackson and others, 2019</xref>). Seven of the eight observation wells are in Yucca Flat and one observation well is downgradient of Yucca Flat. Manual, depth-to-water measurements were used to evaluate drawdowns in five observation wells.</p>
<sec>
<title>Observation Wells with Continuous Water-Level Data</title>
<p>Continuous water-level data were analyzed from March 18, 2004, to November 3, 2004, to estimate drawdowns in seven Yucca Flat observation wells monitored before, during, and after the 90-day constant-rate test. Drawdowns were not analyzed prior to the 90-day constant-rate test because sufficient data were not available. Synthetic water levels matched measured water levels, with root-mean-square errors ranging from 0.01 to 0.08 ft in observation wells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Jackson and others, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Estimated drawdowns were classified as either detected or not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">table 2</xref>).

<p>Water levels in <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> were affected by pumping from wells <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> during the MWAT. Effects of pumping on water levels in <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> were determined by comparing WLMs that either excluded or included pumping from wells <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>. Water levels were modeled initially using only environmental fluctuations from barometric pressure and tides, and measured water levels were explained poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">fig. 8A</xref>). WLM results show a deviation in residuals of about 0.09 ft from March to October 2004. This deviation in residuals indicates that one or more aquifer stresses were not accounted for in the WLM. From March to October 2004, both short-term and long-term pumping was occurring in the LCA. Well <italic>Army 1 WW</italic>, which is open to the LCA, was pumped from 1960 to 2014 for water supply on the NNSS. When long-term pumping from <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> and pumping from the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT were included in the WLM, deviations in the residuals were small (less than 0.02 ft; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>). Maximum estimated drawdown in <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> was about 0.10 ft from both <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> pumping, where most (about 0.08 ft) of the drawdown resulted from the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">fig. 8<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>Observation Wells with Manual Measurements</title>
<p>Manual, depth-to-water measurements in five observation wells were analyzed from November 2003 to January 2005 to estimate drawdowns from pumping during the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT. Maximum estimated drawdowns do not necessarily coincide with peak drawdowns at these wells because manual measurements were made periodically at intervals of 5&#x2013;117 days. Drawdowns were detected if measurements showed visibly discernible water-level declines during <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> pumping. Drawdowns were censored if measurements did not show visibly discernible water-level declines during <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> pumping because any potential drawdown was masked by barometric pressure and tidal forces.</p>
<p>Pumping in well <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> from April 2001 to October 2005 caused water levels to decline by about 6 ft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">fig. 9<italic>A</italic></xref>). Part of this water-level decline in <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> may be attributed to pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> during the MWAT because: (1) drawdowns were detected in <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic>; (2) <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> is between pumping well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> and <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic>; and (3) wells <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>, <italic>Army 1 WW</italic>, and <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic> are open to the LCA.</p>

<title>Hydraulic Connections in Lower Carbonate Aquifer</title>
<p>Hydraulic connections in the LCA were determined from a simulated transmissivity map and drawdowns from <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> pumping. Between Yucca Flat sub-basin and Ash Meadows discharge area, estimated transmissivities are plausible because data are available between these locations and numerical model results agree with observations. Simulated steady-state water levels, spring discharges, and drawdowns replicate observed conditions, which is a measure of agreement.</p>
<p>Simulated drawdowns from the DV3-ER612 model match estimated drawdowns within the limits of estimate uncertainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">figs. 10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>). The pumping history from well <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> was not simulated in the DV3-ER612 model; therefore, simulated drawdowns only account for the effects of pumping from <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>. Wells <italic>ER-6-1-1</italic>, <italic>ER-6-1 main (lower zone)</italic>, and <italic>ER-6-1 main (upper zone)</italic> have similar drawdowns because these observation wells are within 300 ft of the pumping well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">fig. 10<italic>B</italic>&#x2013;<italic>D</italic></xref>). Simulated drawdowns compare more favorably with drawdowns estimated from continuous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">fig. 10</xref>), compared to drawdowns estimated from depth-to-water measurements, because measurement uncertainties in continuous data are less than uncertainties from barometric pressure and tides in depth-to-water measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">fig. 11</xref>).</p>

<p>The groundwater-flow rate from Yucca Flat was estimated previously near well <italic>WW-C-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">fig. 1</xref>; Navarro-Intera, LLC, 2013). This location is at the southern extent of Yucca Flat sub-basin but is not well-suited for use as a control volume for flow from Yucca Flat. This is because 2,800 acre-ft/yr flows past well <italic>WW-C-1</italic>, but less than 600 acre-ft/yr passes through the nuclear testing area north of well <italic>ER-7-</italic>1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">fig. 13</xref>).

<p>Groundwater-flow rates downgradient of underground nuclear testing areas range from 530 to 1,100 acre-ft/yr. The DV3-SS model simulated 530 acre-ft/yr flowing through the transmissive corridor midway between wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>. Simulated water levels in wells <italic>ER-7-1</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> differed by 2.4 ft or 93 percent of the measured head difference. Groundwater-flow rates through the transmissive corridor ranged from 660 to 1,100 acre-ft/yr using harmonic and geometric mean transmissivity-width products, respectively. These estimates were biased higher than estimates from the DV3-SS model because the transmissivity-width product assumed a uniform horizontal hydraulic gradient and perpendicular (north-south) flow for each (east-west) model row used to compute the flow rate. This approach does not account for additional head losses where strong transmissivity contrasts occur in individual model columns. Based on these analyses and their associated uncertainty, less than 600 acre-ft/yr likely flows through the transmissive corridor downgradient of underground nuclear testing areas in Yucca Flat and this flow likely originates from contributing areas that extend from Rainier Mesa to the west, the Halfpint Range to the east, and north of Quartzite Ridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">fig. 13</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to estimate the groundwater-flow rate from southern Yucca Flat at the Nevada National Security Site, southern Nevada, using results from the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> multiple-well aquifer test (MWAT), done during February 5&#x2013;July 23, 2004. Water-level drawdowns associated with pumping from well <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> were evaluated for 13 observation wells. Horizontal distances between pumping and observation wells ranged from 0 to 33 miles (mi). The drawdowns were used as observations in a regional groundwater-flow model to estimate the flow rate from Yucca Flat.</p>
<p>Continuous water-level data were analyzed with water-level models to estimate drawdowns in eight observation wells from pumping during the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT. Drawdowns were detected in six observation wells: <italic>ER-3-1-2 (shallow)</italic>, <italic>ER-6-1 main (lower zone)</italic>, <italic>ER-6-1 main (upper zone)</italic>, <italic>ER-6-1-1</italic>, <italic>ER-7-1</italic>, and <italic>Tracer Well 3.</italic> Drawdowns were not detected in the remaining two observation wells: <italic>ER-6-1-2 piezometer</italic> and <italic>UE-1h</italic>.</p>
<p>Depth-to-water measurements were used to evaluate drawdowns in five observation wells, where discrete measurements were made at approximate weekly-to-quarterly intervals. Drawdowns of more than 1 foot (ft) were detected in wells <italic>U-3cn 5</italic> and <italic>UE-7nS</italic> from pumping during the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT. Environmental water-level fluctuations, predominantly barometric pressure and tides, masked drawdowns in wells <italic>UE-10j (2232-2297 ft)</italic> and <italic>WW-2 (3422 ft)</italic>. Water levels in well <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> were affected by pumping from <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> and <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic>, and numerical results indicated that a maximum drawdown of 0.03 ft in <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> was induced from pumping during the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT.</p>
<p>Estimated drawdowns in observation wells were used to evaluate hydraulic connections within and downgradient of Yucca Flat sub-basin. Water levels in well <italic>UE-1h</italic> were unaffected by pumping during the <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> MWAT, indicating that pumping did not propagate into western Yucca Flat. Simulated drawdowns of less than 0.5 ft occurred in wells <italic>UE-10j (2232-2297 ft)</italic> and <italic>WW-2 (3422 ft)</italic>, showing that pumping propagated more than 14 mi into northern Yucca Flat. Pumping in <italic>ER-6-1-2 main</italic> induced drawdowns downgradient in wells <italic>Army 1 WW</italic> and <italic>Tracer Well 3</italic>, indicating that pumping propagated at least 33 mi to the southwest near the Ash Meadows discharge area. These drawdown results indicate that a high transmissivity corridor extends from well <italic>UE-10j (2232-2297 ft)</italic> in northern Yucca Flat to the Ash Meadows discharge area.</p>
<p>The most probable estimate of groundwater flow moving past underground nuclear testing areas in Yucca Flat sub-basin is less than 600 acre-feet per year (acre-ft/yr). Areas contributing groundwater flow to Yucca Flat extend from Rainier Mesa to the west, the Halfpint Range to the east, and north of Quartzite Ridge. Groundwater-flow rates through the transmissive corridor ranged from 660 to 1,100 acre-ft/yr using harmonic and geometric mean transmissivity-width products, respectively. These estimates are biased high because the transmissivity-width approach assumes a constant hydraulic gradient over an approximately 6-mi distance and does not account for head losses where strong transmissivity contrasts occur in the computed area.</p>
